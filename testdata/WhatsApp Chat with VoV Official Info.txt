Even if you are missing it due to some kind of emergency you have to inform so that a student from backup is sent in place of you.

If any confusion arises ask now.
1/26/20, 10:45 PM - Sayan Dey: Make groups for days you are allotted, or take any alternative plan

 *The dog is the same one who had her leg broken recently, and then infected with canine distemper, a deadly disease.*
 
We are trying to make her drink ORS, cause her has totally stopped eating. She seems to be almost paralized out of weakness. As the exams are approaching we would find it difficult to continue the same, but we are trying our best.

You can feed the dogs with some biscuits or some other food items.* As most of the campus members are leaving, so the students who used to feed the dogs will also leave and the waste food dumped in garbages would also significantly reduce , and hence the dogs would end up starving.
